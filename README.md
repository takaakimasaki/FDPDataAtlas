# Forced Displacement Microdata (FDM) for mapping microdata on forcibly displaced people

This package is a variant of the [original eviatlas package](https://github.com/ESHackathon/eviatlas) and created to visualize data gaps in micro-level data on forcibly displaced people (FDP). To launch an app, you need to run vignettes/run_app.Rmd. The dashboard app is available from: [https://rstudio.unhcr.org/FDMAtlas]([https://wbg-poverty-gp.shinyapps.io/FDPDataAtlas/](https://rstudio.unhcr.org/FDMAtlas)).
